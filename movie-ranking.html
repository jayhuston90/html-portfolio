<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>He Got Game</h3>
<p>The story of the pressures on the nation's best high school basketball player, could have been a gritty docudrama,but it's really more of a heartbreaker about a father and his son.</p>
<h3>Puilp Fiction</h3>
<p>One of the most influential films of the 1990s, A delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thriller,pitch-black humor and pop-culture touchstones.</p>
<h3>Paid In Full</h3>
<p>Though well-acted and non-exploitative, a very well-worn story.</p>
